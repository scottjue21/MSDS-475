# FPD Drinking Metrics Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive project plan comprised of several components learned during the project management course. The project plan focuses on improving sales and operations information at FPD Beverage Company to support management decision-making.

### Business Situation Overview

The CFO and Project Sponsor at FPD Beverage Company initiated a project to improve sales and operations information to support management decision-making. The company generates $350 million in annual revenue across three product lines (coffee, tea, and organic tea) sold through large-box retailers, specialty chains, and grocery stores. Recent operational challenges, including late and incomplete shipments, have caused dissatisfaction among key customers, prompting the need for more efficient data-driven insights.

The primary goal of the project, code-named "FPD Drinking Metrics" (FPD DM), is to develop a comprehensive dashboard for sales and operations performance analysis, including metrics on product line sales, customer order performance, and distribution efficiency. The project has a budget of $250,000 and a six-month timeline. A cloud-based AI tool, QlikSense, will be leveraged for data analysis and dashboard creation, following a waterfall/predictive project management approach with potential hybrid elements.
